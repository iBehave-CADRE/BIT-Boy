# Exercises

Serial Printing is you most powerful debugging tool when coding your device.

You will have to install the Arudino IDE and copy paste the code from here to the sketch. Then compile and upload.

Sometimes the Arduino requires an additional driver installation

Easy and medium are thought in a way that you can make each individual function work individually. Each excersise can be an individual code. You can try to make modules while coding thisn. And then in hard the task is to bring the individual functions to gether and make them work all at once.

Be careful, do not use more than 5V on the BNCs, since we do not have an Ã¼berspannungs schutz.

Useful Resources

Here you can find a complete language reference, built in functions, variable types and structural operators:

## Easy

### 1. Make the LED Blink

```C
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  // use semicolons after each line!

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  // use semicolons after each line!

}

//Useful functions for this exercise:

digitalWrite(pin, value)
//pin: Arduino-Pinnummer.
//value: HIGH or LOW.

pinMode(pin, mode)
//pin: the Arduino pin number to set the mode of.
//mode: INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP.

delay(ms)
//ms: the number of milliseconds to pause. Allowed data types: unsigned long.
```
