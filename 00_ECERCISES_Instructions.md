Serial Printing is your most powerful debugging tool when coding your device.

You will have to install the Arudino IDE and copy paste the code from here to the sketch. Then compile and upload.

[Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)



Sometimes the Arduino will require an additional driver installation. 

Easy and medium exercises are structured such that you can make each individual function work individually. Each excersise being an individual chunk of code. You can try to make modules while coding this. The hard exercises involve bringing the individual functions together to make them work in an integrated device.

Be careful, do not apply more than 5V on the BNCs as the device currently does not have overvoltage protection (Ã¼berspannungs schutz).

Using functions in a scetch:

[How to functions](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/functions/)
How to pass parameters and return data. This is very important for the hard exercises.

For this exercise you will have to use the Serial Plotter and/or Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
