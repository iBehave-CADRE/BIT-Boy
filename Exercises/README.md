# Exercises

Serial Printing is you most powerful debugging tool when coding your device.

You will have to install the Arudino IDE and copy paste the code from here to the sketch. Then compile and upload.

Sometimes the Arduino requires an additional driver installation

Easy and medium are thought in a way that you can make each individual function work individually. Each excersise can be an individual code. You can try to make modules while coding thisn. And then in hard the task is to bring the individual functions to gether and make them work all at once.

Be careful, do not use more than 5V on the BNCs, since we do not have an Ã¼berspannungs schutz.

## Easy

### 1. Make the LED Blink

```C++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  // use semicolons after each line!

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  // use semicolons after each line!

}
```
Useful functions for this exercise:

```C++
digitalWrite(pin, value)
```

pin: Die Arduino-Pinnummer.
value: HIGH oder LOW.

[Documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/de/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/)

```C++
pinMode(pin, mode)
```

pin: the Arduino pin number to set the mode of.
mode: INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP.

[Documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/)



delay(ms)
ms: the number of milliseconds to pause. Allowed data types: unsigned long.

int ledPin = 13;              // LED connected to digital pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital pin as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // sets the LED on
  delay(1000);                // waits for a second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // sets the LED off
  delay(1000);                // waits for a second
}

### 2. Make the Buzzer Beep or Play a Melody

### 3. Plot an Image on the LED Matrix

### 4. Write an Analog or Digital Signal

## Medium

### 1. Read an Analog or Digital Signal and Plot it via Serial Communication

### 2. Implement the Continuity Check

### 3. Implement the DIP Switch

### 4. Implement the Rotary Encoder with Button

### 5. Implement the Rotary Encoder with Button

## Hard

### 1. Read an Analog or Digital and Plot it on the LED Matrix Display

### 2. Combine All Modules and Make them Work Together
