Serial Printing is you most powerful debugging tool when coding your device.

You will have to install the Arudino IDE and copy paste the code from here to the sketch. Then compile and upload.

[Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)



Sometimes the Arduino requires an additional driver installation. 

Easy and medium are thought in a way that you can make each individual function work individually. Each excersise can be an individual code. You can try to make modules while coding thisn. And then in hard the task is to bring the individual functions to gether and make them work all at once.

Be careful, do not use more than 5V on the BNCs, since we do not have an Ã¼berspannungs schutz.

For this exercise you will have to use the Serial Plotter and/or Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
